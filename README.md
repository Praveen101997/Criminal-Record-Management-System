# Criminal Record Management System

Criminal record generally contains personal information about particular person along with photograph. To identify any Criminal we need some identification regarding person, which are given by eyewitness. In most cases the quality and resolution of the recorded image segments is poor and hard to identify a face. To overcome this sort of problem we are developing software. Identification can be done in many ways like finger print, eyes, DNA etc. One of the applications is face identification. The face is our primary focus of attention in social inters course playing a major role in conveying identify and emotion. Although the ability to infer intelligence or character from facial appearance is suspect, the human ability to recognize face is remarkable.
